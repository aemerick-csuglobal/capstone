# Capstone Project

There are several different documents all used to get the results for this project.
There are two files for all the code that was done in SAS and in R.
The dataset for this project was huge and that can be seen in the zip file.
Lastly there are two csv files that contain the zipcode by population for the state of CO and the zip codes that UCHealth already has facilities.
